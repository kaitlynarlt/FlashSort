Long story kind of short, I had to comute 3-4 hours a day to school for about a year. The commute was boring, so, as usual, I tried to tackle a seemingly imposible problem/problem I need a better understanding of. This time, I tried to find a way to sort in O(n) time. Obviously this isn't possible, but I try anyways. I found a way to sort on average in n time, with worst case O(n^2). I later found out that the method I had found is called the flash sort method. It isn't commonly taught in schools due to the fact that it isn't used in industry. It relies on being able to directly access the data that you are working with, which typically isn't something you can do in industry for security reasons for customer data. I decided to code it anyways, for fun. I also coded in a way to record runtime which exports to a text doc that can be easily parsed to produce a graph. Was fun. 10/10 was no longer bored.
